## Train Automation Tool

This is a mod for the game [Factorio](https://factorio.com/). It is published on [the Factorio mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/train-automation-tool) in .zip format. The source code is visible on [the Github page](https://github.com/mheidal/train-automation-tool/).

This mod introduces a customizable tool accessible through the default shortcut 'ALT + A' or the shortcut bar. The tool can be click-and-dragged over trains to change their manual mode.
- Normal selection (by default, `Left-click`) will set all selected trains to `Automatic`.
- Reverse selection (by default, `Right-click`) will set all selected trains to `Manual`.
- Alt-selection (by default, `Shift + Left click`) will toggle the mode of all selected trains (so trains in `Manual` mode will be set to `Automatic` and vice versa.)
